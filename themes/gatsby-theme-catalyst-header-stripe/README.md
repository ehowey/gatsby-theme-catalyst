# Gatsby Theme Catalyst Header Big Top

Sibling theme for `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core` which adds a "big" site header and navbar using latent component shadowing. Branding/Logo on top, large. Navigation underneath the logo. Social links in the top right corner. Theme options are set set via `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core`, for example setting `displaySiteTitle: false` and `displaySiteTitleMobile: false` will only show the logo for branding.

_Note this header does not support the `useStickyHeader` theme option_. The header is static when in "desktop" view and "sticky" when in mobile view. This behaviour could be changed via variants if needed.

You can see a styled implementation of this in [gatsby-theme-catalyst-helium](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-helium.netlify.app).

## About Gatsby Theme Catalyst

The Catalyst series of themes and starters for [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) were designed to provide an opinionated set of integrated themes and starters that can be used to accelerate your next Gatsby project. The vision is for one "core" theme in which most dependencies and components are contained followed by progressively more styled and refined child themes and starters. These themes rely heavily on [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/gatsby/).
