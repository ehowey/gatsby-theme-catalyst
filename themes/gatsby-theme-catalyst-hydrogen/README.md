# Gatsby Theme Catalyst Hydrogen

This is a full-featured theme that ties together the core theme, header and footer themes and then uses this as a basis to create a complete website. The theme relies on data from [SANITY.io](https://www.sanity.io/) and includes a customized content studio for the CMS.

## Catalyzing Start

```sh
# create a new Gatsby site using the catalyst writer starter site
gatsby new catalyst-hydrogen https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-hydrogen
```

## Theme options

Hydrogen accepts all options from the core theme and sanity theme directly, e.g. you can set `sanityProjectId` via `gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen` and it is passed down to the correct theme appropriately. You may want to consider using environment variables for some of your SANITY.io information, if you are using a token then you _need_ to use environment variables so you do not commit this to GitHub.

For example the following config is valid:

```js
{
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen`,
      options: {
        // Core theme
        invertLogo: false,
        footerContentLocation: "right",
        useStickyHeader: true,
        // Sanity theme
        sanityProjectId: "abc123",
        sanityDataset: "development",
      },
    },
```

### Environment Variables

You can read the [Gatsby docs about environment variables](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/environment-variables/) which may be helpful.

At the top of your gatsby-config.js file you will want the following, `require("dotenv").config()`

Then in your site you can create a `.env` file in your main site directory with the following information. You do not want to commit this file to git as the token should remain private.

Example .env:

```env
SANITY_PROJECT_ID = utcr8kb1
SANITY_DATASET = production
SANITY_TOKEN = skRE6nh0PRCFP4juyGzMC7gvlop (actual token is much longer)
```

Example Config:

```js
{
  resolve: `gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen`,
  options: {
    sanityProjectID: process.env.SANITY_PROJECT_ID,
    sanityDataset: process.env.SANITY_DATASET,
  },
},
```
