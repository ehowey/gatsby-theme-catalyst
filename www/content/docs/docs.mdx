# Docs

Welcome to documentation for Gatsby Theme Catalyst!

The best place to begin is the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide. These docs are written assuming you have some basic familiarity with Gatsby and modern web development practices.

## About Gatsby Theme Catalyst

Gatsby Theme Catalyst is an an opinionated set of integrated themes and starters that can be used as a boilerplate to accelerate your next [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) project. There is a single "core" theme in which most dependencies and utility components are contained followed by progressively more styled and refined child themes and starters. These themes use [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/gatsby/).
