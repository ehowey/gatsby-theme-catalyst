# Roadmap

- **Improved header themes:** The header themes will retain the same (or improved) functionality. The two areas I would like to improve are a11y and animations. There are outstanding a11y issues with focus trapping for mobile menu users. I would also like to give the menus a small animation on open and close to improve their visual feel.

- **Stripe integration:** I have started some preliminary work on a Stripe integration with [use-shopping-cart](https://useshoppingcart.com/) and plan to finish this in the near future.

- **Typescript support:** Typescript support is something I will be working on in late 2021 after the e-commerce integration is complete.

- **More and better tests:** MORE tests!! But seriously I have some minimal end-to-end tests in place with Cypress that will catch build-breaking problems and a few other important issues but I am hoping to revamp these tests as well over the next year.
