# Theme Options

There are a number of options for the themes that act as flags to control various aspects of the site appearance and function. Try experimenting with these to get a feel for how it changes the site. The options for each theme are documented in the respective docs area for the themes. Most options are set via `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core`, however `gatsby-theme-catalyst-sanity` uses theme options extensively to control what pages are created by the theme.

For example:

```js
{
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core`,
      options: {
        //Default options are:
        // contentPath: `content/pages`,
        // assetPath: `content/assets`,
        // displaySiteLogo: true,
        // displaySiteTitle: true,
        // displaySiteLogoMobile: true,
        // displaySiteTitleMobile: true,
        // invertSiteLogo: false,
        // useStickyHeader: false,
        // useSocialLinks: true,
        // useColorMode: true,
// useKatex: false,
        //footerContentLocation: "left", // "left", "right", "center"
      },
    },
```
