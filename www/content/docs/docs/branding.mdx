# Branding

See [Theme-UI](/docs/theme-ui) for information on changing colors and fonts.

## Changing logos and logo sizes

The logo is found by default in the `src/content/assets` folder under the names `catalyst-site-logo.png`. Change this file to reflect your branding. You can use other file extensions, e.g. .jpg but you cannot change the file name. It is queried by file name for those that know graphQL, not by relativePath. So it will work with `catalyst-site-logo.jpg` but not with `logo-main.jpg`.

The logo size is managed in the following location: `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`. In many cases the size of your logo will control the size of your navbar/header. There is also an option in the sizes file which can override the auto height inherited from content and specify a fixed height.

Try this in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js` for a big logo:

```js
  sizes: {
    ...tailwind.sizes,
    maxPageWidth: "1440px", // Sets the max width of elements like the header/footer on really large screens
    maxContentWidth: "60ch", // Sets the container size on larger screens, e.g. tablets and laptops
    headerHeight: "auto", // Provides fallback setting to control header height
    logoWidthXS: "80px", // Logo width on extra small screens, up to 480px
    logoWidthS: "150px", // Logo width on small screens, 480px - 768px
    logoWidthM: "150px", // Logo width on medium screens, 768px - 1024px
    logoWidthL: "260px", // Logo width on large screens, 1024px - 1440px
    logoWidthXL: "260px", // Logo width on extra large screens, above 1440px
    logoHeightXS: "80px", // Logo height on extra small screens, up to 480px
    logoHeightS: "150px", // Logo height on small screens, 480px - 768px
    logoHeightM: "150px", // Logo height on medium screens, 768px - 1024px
    logoHeightL: "260px", // Logo height on large screens, 1024px - 1440px
    logoHeightXL: "260px", // Logo height on extra large screens, above 1440px
    iconsFooter: "32px", // Sets the icons size for the footer
    iconsHeader: "20px", // Sets the icons size for the header
  },
```

## catalyst-site-logo.png

The logo used for your site, see paragraphs above for details.

## catalyst-site-social.png

This file is used as the default image in places like Twitter and Facebook. This file is best in a 2:1 aspect ratio, something like 1200x600px. See the [twitter card docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image) for more information. You can use alternate image types such as .jpg if you want. It is queried by file name for those that know graphQL, not by relativePath. So it will work with `catalyst-social.jpg` but not with `social-image.jpg`.

## catalyst-site-icon.png

There is also a file called `catalyst-site-icon.png` that provides your icon for use `gatsby-plugin-manifest` to create icons for web, PWA, etc. This file should be square and at least 512x512px in dimensions.
