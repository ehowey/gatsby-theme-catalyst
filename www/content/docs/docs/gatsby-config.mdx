# Gatsby-Config.js

Site metadata is set via the `gatsby-config.js` file. Specifically the navigation menu, social links menu, author name, site title, etc. The starter sites come with some pre-configured options you can modify. Most of these are fairly standard and where possible I have included inline comments in the starters to help explain.

## Menu Links

The `menuLinks` array is fairly common in Gatsby sites with the addition of two fields, `type` and `location`. `type` controls whether the menu link is rendered as a Gatsby Link component or an anchor link component using [react-scroll](https://github.com/fisshy/react-scroll). The options are `internal` or `anchor`. `location` controls the location of the links on either the left or the right side. At present the location field is only supported by `gatsby-theme-catalyst-header-top` as this allows you to "split" your links putting some links beside the logo and other links on the far side of the menu as is common in e-commerce sites with carts. If the location field is omitted it defaults to right.

Example Config:

```js
menuLinks: [
  {
    name: `Page 1`,
    link: `/page-1`,
    type: `internal`, //internal or anchor
    location: `left`,
  },
  {
    name: `Anchor 1`,
    link: `#anchor-1`,
    type: `anchor`, //internal or anchor
    location: `right`,
  },
]
```

You can also have a sub-menu or dropdown menu. Submenus are only supported on internal links at this time. You can see an example of this with `gatsby-starter-catalyst`.

> I am in the process of updating the dropdowns to function as toggles instead of on hover. This means the dropdowns themselves will not be an active link any more, but they still require some unique text in the link field as this is used in handling the toggle behaviour.

Example Config:

```js
menuLinks: [
  {
    name: `Page 1`,
    link: `/page-1`,
    type: `internal`, //internal or anchor
    subMenu: [
      {
        name: `Sub 1`,
        link: `/sub-1`,
        type: `internal`, //internal or anchor
      },
      {
        name: `Sub 2`,
        link: `/sub-2`,
        type: `internal`, //internal or anchor
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

## Social Links

The `socialLinks` array is a bit more uncommon. You can specify a social media provider such as Twitter and also three different locations in the settings, `header`, `footer`, and `all` which will locate the icons appropriately. It will work with most major social platforms and has a fallback for displaying the text if a logo isn't found.

Example Config:

```js
socialLinks: [
      {
        name: `Email`,
        link: `eric@erichowey.dev`,
        location: `footer`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
      {
        name: `Github`,
        link: `https://www.github.com/ehowey`,
        location: `all`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
      {
        name: `Twitter`,
        link: `https://www.twitter.com/erchwy`,
        location: `header`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
    ],
```
