# Accessibility

Accessibility is critical for all websites.

Currently this theme is scoring 100 in Google Lighthouse audit for accessibility and passing tests using [cypress-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-axe). Skip nav functionality is implemented following the [blog post from Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-02-10-accessible-client-side-routing-improvements/) on the topic.

I have made every effort to address accessibility issues in these themes and starters but would love additional feedback and help with more advanced accessibility topics as I am sure there are things I missed.
