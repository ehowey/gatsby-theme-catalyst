# gatsby-theme-catalyst-bery

This theme is for a personal blog and demonstrates tight integration with [SANITY.io](https://www.sanity.io/) as the CMS and Gatsby as the frontend. It comes with a preconfigured content schema for SANITY.io and demonstration data you can import for a quick start. It features SEO optimization, social image sharing, RSS feed integration, and a clean design language that focuses on your content.

This is also an example of "ejecting" from using a preset header themes and building your own custom header to interact with the other Catalyst themes. The header used here is completely custom for this theme, and not one of the prebuilt options available.

## Demos

- [gatsby-starter-catalyst-bery](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-bery.netlify.app/)

## Catalyzing Start

Because this theme and starter relies on a SANITY.io backend there are a few additional steps to get up and running.

### Install the theme and starter

```shell
## Install the theme and starter
gatsby new bery https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-bery
cd bery
```

### Install SANITY.io

```shell
## Initiate a new SANITY project using their CLI
cd sanity-studio
sanity install
## Setup a new SANITY.io dataset
## Choose Yes to reconfigure the SANITY project
## Chose Yes to use the default dataset configuration
sanity init
## Import the placeholder data
## Import to the "production" dataset
cd data
sanity dataset import production.tar.gz
# Deploy the graphql schema
cd ..
sanity graphql deploy
# Start your studio on a localhost
sanity start
```

### Update your gatsby-config

You need to update the `sanityProjectId` from SANITY.io so that the theme can properly source its data. You can find this at the top of the file `sanity-studio/sanity.json`.

Update your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
{
  resolve: `gatsby-theme-catalyst-bery`,
  options: {
    sanityProjectId: `c1x70rzt`, // Change this line
  },
},
```

### Run gatsby develop

Open a new terminal window and run `gatsby develop` in the root directory. Your site will build in [watch mode](https://www.sanity.io/blog/get-started-with-gatsby-and-structured-content) with real time previews hot reloaded from SANITY.io! With both SANITY and Gatsby running at the same time you can make edits in your SANITY.io backend and immediately see those updates on your site.

## Theme options

Bery accepts all options from the core theme and sanity theme directly, e.g. you can set `useColorMode` via `gatsby-theme-catalyst-bery` and it is passed down to the correct theme appropriately. Note that because of the custom header component and the theme design some theme options may not work as expected - e.g. the site title and avatar image are not optional as they hardcoded into the custom header. This theme was built with a more singluar design and is best modified via component shadowing if needed.

For example the following config is valid:

```js
{
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-catalyst-bery`,
      options: {
        sanityProjectId: `4w5ygwpy`, // Required
        sanityPostListTitle: "Posts",
        rssTitle: "My Great Blog",
        rssDescription: "A little description of who I am and why I am great.",
        // Defaults
        // sanityPostPath: `/posts`,
        // footerContentLocation: "center",
        // sanityPostListTitle: "Blog",
        // sanityPostListPath: `/`,
      },
    },
```

### Core Theme Options

_Note that many of these options will not work with catalyst-bery but are still accessible in the theme options config. This is because the theme is more custom and has a unified design._
