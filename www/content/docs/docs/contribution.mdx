# Contribution

Gatsby Theme Catalyst is an open source project and contributions from the community are welcomed and ecnouraged. All contributions are welcomed whether it is fixing a typo or refactoring a component.

The easiest way to get started with a contribution is to fork the main repo from GitHub. The repo is setup as a monorepo using [Yarn workspaces](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-05-22-setting-up-yarn-workspaces-for-theme-development/). Testing is handled by [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/). Publishing is handled by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). The starters are copied post-commit to their own repo using a [GitHub action](https://johno.com/publishing-gatsby-starters-from-monorepo/) - some of the Gatsby CLI commands require a starter to be in its own repo.

There are some custom commands that make working in the project easier, which follow this pattern, `yarn develop:blog`, or `yarn test:helium`. You can see a full list of commands in the root `package.json`.

The documentation is contained in the main repo, at `www/content/docs/docs`. Development on the docs site is started by running the command, `yarn develop:www`.

I can be contacted via email at: [eric@erichowey.dev](mailto:eric@erichowey.dev) if you have questions.
