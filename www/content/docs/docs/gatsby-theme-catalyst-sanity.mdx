# gatsby-theme-catalyst-sanity

This theme adds a data layer for SANITY.io on top of `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core` via component shadowing. This is used as a "core" theme for SANITY.io and is designed to be modified and shadowed itself in the final site. You can see an example of this theme stacked and further customized with [gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen](/docs/gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen).

## Sanity Studio

There is a custom [sanity studio](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-studio) and data structure located in the starter. This studio should be used as a "base" studio and built on top of for custom content. You can use the [desk structure](https://www.sanity.io/docs/structure-builder-introduction) to control whether certain actions are visible to the user or not - e.g. don't want them to see the "Projects" folder, just hide it via the desk structure.

This is a compromised solution, it makes iterating and building a site with SANITY.io as the backend faster and easier - but it locks you in to a base set of data the themes require to successfully build. It is a tradeoff but one that is worth it for a lot of use cases.

## Shadowed components

`useSiteMetadata.js`: This is heart of what allows this theme to function as this hook is used throughout all of the themes to source data like site title, logo, etc. Changing the source form `gatsby-config` to SANITY.io allows all of these components to be updated without having to actual change their code.

`seo.js`: This is shadowed to ensure that social images are sourced correctly.

## gatsby-node.js

There is quite a bit going on in `gatsby-node.js` to manage the createPages api from Gatsby. Theme options are used to conditionally build pages in the build process - this means that if you want a blog on your site the "infrastructure" is there in gatsby-node to create the pages but can be turned on/off based on whether you need this feature. This results in some warnings in the build process.

`gatsby-node.js` is also used to automatically create excerpts and reading time for both projects and posts, this relies on an extended base studio configuration as it looks for the "body" field to create the excerpts. This implementation is based on [gatsby-transformer-portable-text](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/packages/gatsby-transform-portable-text/).

## Query components and template components

Queries and templates are separated to isolate visual components from data components. This is best practice in a Gatsby theme and means that in most cases you can just modify the visual layer through component shadowing and leave the data alone letting you concentrate on design.

These are located at `src/components/queries/` and `src/components/templates/`.

You can see an example of this in use with `gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen`.
