# Seo

By default Gatsby provides excellent Seo out of the box. I have extended this with a custom Seo component based on [gatsby-plugin-react-helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/) that provides basic open graph, canononical links, and metadata tags. It also provides a default social sharing image based on `content/assets/catalyst-site-social.jpg`.

In addition to this the following are worth notiing:

- The blog theme has a "featuredImage" field in the frontmatter which replaces the default social image.

- If a Twitter profile is included in the `socialLinks` field in `gatsby-config.js` it automatically generates the correct metadata tags based on your profile.

- MDX pages are automatically provided with an Seo component (you don't need to import it) to customize page metadata tags like the page title, description, image, and keywords.

```js
<Seo title="Seo" description="Custom Seo page description" />
```
