# SEO

By default Gatsby provides excellent SEO out of the box. I have extended this with a custom SEO component based on [gatsby-plugin-react-helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/) that provides basic open graph and metadata tags. It also provides a default social sharing image based on `catalyst-site-social.png`. The blog theme has a "featuredImage" field in the frontmatter which replaces the default social image. If a Twitter profile is included in the `socialLinks` field in `gatsby-config.js` it automatically generates the correct metadata tags based on your profile.

MDX pages are automatically provided with an SEO component (you don't need to import) to customize page metadata tags like the page title, description, and keywords.

```js
<SEO title="SEO" description="Custom SEO page description" />
```
