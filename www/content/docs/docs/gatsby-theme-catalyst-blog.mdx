# gatsby-theme-catalyst-blog

This adds a blogging interface using MDX, similar to `gatsby-theme-blog-core` with some custom modifications. The theme can be added to any existing Catalyst-based site and will add blog functionality. This is a minimal implementation that is not designed to be used in a production site, but rather as a jumping off point for a production site.

The main features added to this blog theme are:

- Support for a featured image on the blog posts
- Support for a social image on the blog posts
- Support for RSS feed
- Support for categories and tags
- Support for different post types in the frontmatter to allow for conditional styling of posts
- Drafts flag in frontmatter so you can keep posts in your repo that are drafts and not built in the final site
- Ability to control the excerpt length used in post summaries
- Drafts
- Reading time support
