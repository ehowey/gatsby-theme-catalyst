# Migrating

This reviews any breaking changes. You can check the [changelog file](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) on GitHub for more detailed list of non-breaking changes.

## catalyst-core v3.0.0 and other packages with a major bump

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Removed [gatsby-plugin-offline](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-offline/) from the core theme as there are more considerations and impacts from service workers than should be included in the core theme. This plugin has a lot of power and I would suggest using it on most Gatsby sites but want to leave this as an optional addition versus a forced inclusion in the core theme. If you want to include `gatsby-plugin-offline` in your site you would just add it to your main `gatsby-config.js` file following the instructions at the link above.

## catalyst-sanity v4.0.0, catalyst-bery v2.0.0, catalyst-hydrogen v.4.0.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** In order to support split links properly in the header components I needed to update the schema coming from your SANITY studio. Unfortunately this means you also need to update your schema and re-deploy the graphQL schema.

- Copy and paste `sanity-studio/schema/menuLinks.js` from any current SANITY based starter into your existing studio. Update the location field in your studio for the menu links. The default behaviour is to have the links on the right but now it supports handling them on the left as well.

- Redeploy the graphql schema with the command `sanity graphql deploy`

## catalyst-sanity v3.0.0 and catalyst-hydrogen v3.0.0

- There was a breaking change in order to enable to support for categories in SANITY based blogs. This required adding a schema for blog categories which needs to be included in older installations of these themes, even if you are not using a blog.
  - Copy `gatsby-starter-catalyst-sanity/sanity-studio/schemas/category.js` and put it in your own schemas folder in your installation.
  - Import the category.js schema in `sanity-studio/schemas/schema.js` and make sure it is included in the concatenated set of export schemas
  - Run `sanity graphql deploy` to redeploy your GraphQL schema

## catalyst-core v2.0.0 and other v2.0.0 themes

- This was a visually breaking change to make it easier to remove dark mode from your site. `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core` exports a "base theme" which is used in the starters to merge with any theme customizations. By default it was including a dark mode meaning that it was difficult to remove dark mode without overriding all of the key value pairs in your site. If you were relying on the core theme for your site colors then you will now need to explicitly define those in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`.

- This required a version bump for most other themes as they rely on the core theme. No other breaking changes were introduced.

- This will particularly affect `gatsby-theme-catalyst-helium` as your dark mode was being merged in. Ensure that your dark mode colors object located at `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js` looks similar to this:

```js
dark: {
  background: baseColors.gray[9],
  text: baseColors.gray[1],
  textGray: "#9f9f9f",
  primary: "#e6da00",
  secondary: "#9933CC",
  muted: "#1a2431",
  accent: "#363636",
  link: "#e6da00",
  header: {
    background: "transparent",
    text: baseColors.gray[1],
    textOpen: baseColors.gray[1],
    backgroundOpen: baseColors.gray[8],
    icons: baseColors.gray[1],
    iconsOpen: baseColors.gray[1],
  },
  footer: {
    background: "transparent",
    text: baseColors.gray[1],
    links: baseColors.gray[1],
    icons: baseColors.gray[1],
  },
},
```

- Here is another example from `gatsby-starter-catalyst` and you can see the full colors are now defined in the starter whereas before they were being merged from the `baseTheme`.

```js
import { merge } from "theme-ui"
import { BaseTheme } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core"
import { tailwind, baseColors } from "@theme-ui/preset-tailwind"

export default merge(BaseTheme, {
  // Modifications to the base theme go here. This is an example changing colors and using variants to change your navigation links. Uncomment the code below to see what happens.
  colors: {
    ...tailwind.colors,
    background: baseColors.gray[1], //Try "#954264",
    text: baseColors.gray[8],
    textGray: "#6e6e6e",
    primary: baseColors.blue[7],
    secondary: baseColors.orange[7],
    accent: baseColors.orange[2],
    highlight: baseColors.orange[5],
    muted: baseColors.gray[2],
    header: {
      background: baseColors.gray[2],
      backgroundOpen: baseColors.blue[2],
      text: baseColors.gray[8],
      textOpen: baseColors.gray[8],
      icons: baseColors.gray[6],
      iconsOpen: baseColors.gray[8],
    },
    footer: {
      background: baseColors.gray[2],
      text: baseColors.gray[8],
      links: baseColors.gray[8],
      icons: baseColors.gray[8],
    },
    // You can delete dark mode by removing the "modes" object and setting useColorMode to false in gatsby-theme-catalyst-core
    modes: {
      dark: {
        background: baseColors.gray[9],
        text: baseColors.gray[1],
        textGray: "#9f9f9f",
        primary: "#458ad2",
        secondary: baseColors.orange[7],
        accent: baseColors.gray[8],
        highlight: baseColors.orange[5],
        muted: baseColors.gray[8],
        header: {
          text: baseColors.gray[1],
          textOpen: baseColors.gray[1],
          background: "#232946",
          backgroundOpen: baseColors.gray[8],
          icons: baseColors.gray[1],
          iconsOpen: baseColors.gray[1],
        },
        footer: {
          background: "#232946",
          text: baseColors.gray[1],
          links: baseColors.gray[1],
          icons: baseColors.gray[1],
        },
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    siteTitle: {
      fontSize: [3, 4, null, 5, null],
    },
  },
})
```

## catalyst-sanity v2.0.0

- The default queries and templates were updated to rely on `excerpt` instead of `_rawExcerpt`. Going forward though this allows for an easier authoring experience and simpler sanity studio as the post and project excerpts are automatically generated based on the post content. If you are migrating from an older version of `gatsby-theme-catalyst-sanity` it should work without any changes however your "excerpts" are now sourced directly from the post content rather than being sourced from the excerpt field in sanity studio.

You can see examples of the changes in the `src/components/queries` folder and `src/components/templates` folder.

## catalyst-blog v2.0.0

- This was a breaking change to allow for better component architecture, remove the need for a `featuredImage` and add in a number of additional frontmatter fields, like `socialImage`.
- Rewrite of the core blog theme to be more basic and act as as "data" theme with fewer presentational components. Less you have to undo as a developer, however if you were using version 1.0 or earlier a lot of the styles you would have had are gone. The good news however is that these styles can be easily added back in via component shadowing. You can look at [gatsby-theme-catalyst-lithium](/docs/gatsby-theme-catalyst-lithium/) to see how this is done and copy those files and tweak to your liking.
- If you have trouble migrating let me know and I will help out. v1.0 of this theme will work for a long time to come, so no rush.
- You can see an example of this migration on my personal blog, [https://github.com/ehowey/erichoweydev](https://github.com/ehowey/erichoweydev), if you look at the code you can see how the components are shadowed and the blog is implemented.

## v1.0.0

- Move your theme-ui file from `src/gatsby-theme-catalyst-core/theme.js` -> `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`. No other change should be needed. This was done to be more in line with recommended best practice. There is now a 'base theme' for Theme-UI which is exported from `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core`. You can use this to write smaller and more condensed themes in the starters using the following syntax:

```js
import { merge } from "theme-ui"
import { BaseTheme } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core"

export default merge(BaseTheme, {
  // Modifications to the base theme go here. This is an example changing colors and using variants to change your navigation links. Uncomment the code below to see what happens.
})
```

- Depreciated `gatsby-theme-catalyst-writer` in favor of `gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen`. If you were using the writer theme it will continue to work, and will work for a long time to come. If you want to migrate to hydrogen then it will be possible with a little effort as the expected data structures from SANITY were unchanged. The main change you need to make is to ensure you have the same SANITY.io schema files in your site as in the theme as this is where the GraphQL query is generated from. If you are having trouble migrating please get in touch via issues and I will help you out.

- This is technically not a breaking change but it could change your sites appearance. Base navigation link styles were simplified in the structural themes and then added back in for the presentational themes using variants in the Theme-UI file. You can see an example of this in `gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen` if you would like to see how to do it on your site, look in `gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js` towards the end of the file.

**Removal of isMobile Context and mobileMenuBreakpoint**

These are depreciated and will stop working post v1.0. There was a perfomance issue with SSR and javascript that was causing a flash of unstyled content. I have reverted back to using normal media queries for changing to the mobile menu at the second breakpoint, 768px by default.
