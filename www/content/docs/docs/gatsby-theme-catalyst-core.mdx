# gatsby-theme-catalyst-core

This acts as a core theme on which all other themes are based. It houses a basic site architecture, as much logic as possible, along with most dependencies. Imagine this as the foundation of a house. There are some latent components which are used to enable easy shadowing in child themes. There are minimal styles applied at this stage. For an example of what this can look like when finished with styles and other themes check out - [gatsby-starter-catalyst-hydrogen](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-hydrogen.netlify.app/).

## Remark Plugins

[gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) uses standard Gatsby remark plugins to help manage the markdown content. The following plugins are installed and configured:

- gatsby-remark-relative-images
- gatsby-remark-images
- gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files
- gatsby-remark-smartypants
- gatsby-remark-reading-time
- gatsby-remark-external-links
- gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe

One notable omission is `gatsby-remark-autolink-headers` - this is handled through Theme-UI and headers are currently receiving an automatic ID which can be linked to.

You can customize the max image width generated by `gatsby-remark-images` via the theme option `remarkImagesWidth`, default max width is 1440px.
