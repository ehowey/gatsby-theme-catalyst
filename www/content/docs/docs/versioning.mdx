# Versioning

This project uses unified versioning, with all current packages, themes and starters being at the same version once they are stable.

Anything pre v1.0 is in active development and should be used with caution.

Significant changes and feature additions are noted in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

Breaking changes are covered under the [migrating docs](/docs/migrating/).

## A note about v6.0

You might notice that you are upgrading some themes straight from v1.x to v6.x. This is because there was one theme (the very first presentation theme I made) which was already on v5.x so in order for all of the themes to be unified and on a consistent version every theme had to jump to v6.0.
