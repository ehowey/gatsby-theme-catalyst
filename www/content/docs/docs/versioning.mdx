# Versioning

> This project will be moving to unified versioning in the near future. Independent versioning is confusing for users as it is unclear what themes will work together.

Themes and starters follow semantic versioning and are versioned independently.

Anything post v1.0 is stable and changes are focused on improving function, adding features, bug fixes, etc.

Anything pre v1.0 is in active development and should be used with caution.

Significant changes and feature additions are noted in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

Breaking changes are covered under the [migrating docs](/docs/migrating/).
