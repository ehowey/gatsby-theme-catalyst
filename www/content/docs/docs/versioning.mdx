# Versioning

This project uses unified versioning, with all current packages, themes and starters being at the same version once they are stable.

Anything pre v1.0 is in active development and should be used with caution.

Significant changes and feature additions are noted in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

Breaking changes are covered under the [migrating docs](/docs/migrating/).
