# Configuring Themes

Most of the theme configuration is handled in one of three ways; via `gatsby-config.js`, via Theme-UI, and via component shadowing. This gives you the flexibility to completely customize the final appearance and visual design of your site.

- [Gatsby-Config.js](/docs/gatsby-config): This is where your siteMetadata is located along with arrays like `menuLinks` and `socialLinks` which provide information to the themes.
- [Theme Options](/docs/theme-options): These act as feature flags or ways to communicate information into the themes.
- [Branding](/docs/branding): Branding including logos is easily modified.
- [Theme-UI](/docs/theme-ui): Theme UI provides a theme specification file which controls colors, fonts, spacing, design, etc. Variants allow for extendable CSS right in the theme file.
- [Component Shadowing](/docs/component-shadowing): Component shadowing allows you to completely rewrite or redesign entire aspects of these themes in your starter.
