# Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge all of the help I have gotten in working on this project from people answering questions on the GatsbyJS issues, [Chris Biscardi's blog](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/), and the work that [@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine) and [@jxnblk](https://twitter.com/jxnblk) have done documenting Theme-ui so well.

The vision for this set of themes was heavily influenced by [WP Rig](https://wprig.io/) and [Underscores](https://underscores.me/) from the Wordpress world. My hope was to create a similar kind of simple boilerplate that could be used as a jumping off point for my own custom work.
