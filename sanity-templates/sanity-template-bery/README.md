# Gatsby Theme Catalyst Bery

This theme is for a personal blog and demonstrates tight integration with [SANITY.io](https://www.sanity.io/) as the CMS and Gatsby as the frontend. It comes with a preconfigured content schema for SANITY.io and demonstration data you can import for a quick start. It features SEO optimization, social image sharing, RSS feed integration, and a clean design language that focuses on your content.

This is also an example of "ejecting" from using a preset header themes and building your own custom header to interact with the other Catalyst themes. The header used here is completely custom for this theme, and not one of the prebuilt options available.

## About Gatsby Theme Catalyst

The Catalyst series of themes and starters for [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) were designed to provide an opinionated set of integrated themes and starters that can be used to accelerate your next Gatsby project. The vision is for one "core" theme in which most dependencies and components are contained followed by progressively more styled and refined child themes and starters. These themes rely heavily on [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/gatsby/).
