# Gatsby Theme Catalyst Sanity

This theme adds a data layer for SANITY.io on top of `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core` via component shadowing. This is used as a "core" theme for SANITY.io and is designed to be modified and shadowed itself in the final site. You can see an example of this theme stacked and further customized with [gatsby-theme-catalyst-bery](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-bery.netlify.app/).

## About Gatsby Theme Catalyst

The Catalyst series of themes and starters for [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) were designed to provide an opinionated set of integrated themes and starters that can be used to accelerate your next Gatsby project. The vision is for one "core" theme in which most dependencies and components are contained followed by progressively more styled and refined child themes and starters. These themes rely heavily on [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/gatsby/).
