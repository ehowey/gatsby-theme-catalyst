# Gatsby Starter Catalyst Core

This implements only `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core` on which all other themes are based. This is probably too bare bones for most projects but could be a starting point if you wanted to build entirely custom headers and footers.

## About Gatsby Theme Catalyst

The Catalyst series of themes and starters for [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) were designed to provide an opinoinated set of integrated themes and starters that can be used to accelerate your next Gatsby project. The vision is for one "core" theme in which most dependencies and components are contained followed by progressively more styled and refined child themes and starters. These themes rely heavily on [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/gatsby/).
